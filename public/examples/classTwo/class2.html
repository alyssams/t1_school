	<h1 style="color:brown;">HOW HELVETICA CONQUERED THE WORLD WTH ITS COOL.</h1>
	<h2>The digital version of Helvetica that everyone knows and uses today is quite different from the typeface's pre-digital design from 1957. <br>Originally released as Neue Haas Grotesk, many of the features that made it a Modernist favorite have been lost in translation over the years from one typesetting technology to the next.</h2>
	<h3 style="color:red">"The font also manages to convey honesty ad invite trust."</h3>
<!-- <p>The Helvetica typeface is one of the most famous and popular in the world.</p> -->
	<ol>
		<li>The text styles of <a href="http://www.fontbureau.com/nhg/">Helvetica</a> come equipped with a set of tabular numerals and related symbols.</li>
		<li>Neue Haas Grotesk includes features for numeric typography, including proper fractions, separate numerators and denominators.</li>
		<li>With language support for Afrikaans, Basque, Breton, Catalan, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, Estonian, Finnish.</li>
	</ol>
	<ul>
		<li>The <a href="http://www.fontbureau.com/nhg/">Helvetica</a> obliques that come installed on every Mac today were generated mechanically by skewing regular upright forms 12.</li>
		<li>A number of alternate forms were offered by request for the original Neue Haas Grotesk.</li>
		<li>When all-caps styling is applied, numerals and punctuation marks will be replaced with variants that align better with the capital letters.</li>
	</ul>
